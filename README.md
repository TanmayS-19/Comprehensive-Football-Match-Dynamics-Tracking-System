### 1. Introduction

Football analytics has gained prominence in professional sports, with applications in player evaluation, team strategy, and fan engagement. However, manually analyzing match footage is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This project aims to automate the analysis of football match footage, bridging the gap between raw video data and meaningful metrics. 

Key objectives include:
- Detecting and tracking players, referees, and the ball with high accuracy.
- Assigning team identities based on t-shirt colors.
- Estimating ball trajectories during occlusions.
- Correcting distortions caused by angled camera perspectives.
- Calculating real-world metrics like speed and distance.
- Enhancing match analysis through visualization and intuitive data representation.

### 2. Object Detection and Tracking

#### 2.1 Tools and Technology
- **YOLO Models**: Initially utilized YOLOv8x for object detection and later fine-tuned YOLOv5x for improved performance.
- **OpenCV**: Managed video frame processing and visualization.
- **Roboflow**: Provided pre-annotated datasets for fine-tuning object detection models.

#### 2.2 Methodology
The project began with the [**DFL Bundesliga Data Shootout Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/data?select=clips), which provided high-resolution match footage. While YOLOv8x demonstrated robust detection capabilities, several limitations were identified:

- Misclassification of spectators and staff as on-pitch objects.
- Lack of distinction among players, referees, and goalkeepers.
- Frequent failures in detecting the ball during rapid movements or occlusions.

To overcome these challenges, we fine-tuned the YOLOv5x model using a dataset from [**Roboflow**](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1). This process involved training for 100 epochs with diverse scenarios, enabling the model to:

- Detect only on-pitch objects, including players, referees, and the ball.
- Differentiate between referees, goalkeepers, and outfield players.
- Improve the consistency of ball detection, even during high-speed sequences.

**Tracking Implementation:**
- Detection results were passed to the **Supervision** library tracker to assign consistent IDs across frames.
- A dictionary-based structure stored tracking data for players, referees, and the ball. This ensured smooth frame-to-frame continuity and reliable identification of entities.

#### 2.3 Visualization of Bounding Boxes and Circles

![Screenshot 2024-12-21 135342](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c61807ec-28c0-4d99-b152-66c82e5aefec)

After training the model, bounding boxes for players were replaced with minimalistic circles. The color of the circles, derived through K-Means clustering, matched the team jersey colors. Referees were given yellow circles for clear differentiation. Each circle included the player’s unique index to maintain clarity during playback.

The ball was marked separately with a red triangle placed above its bounding box, enhancing its visibility in dynamic scenarios. This step was implemented to distinguish the ball from other tracked objects effectively.

Later in the project, players in possession of the ball were further marked with a red triangle above their respective circles. This feature allowed for clear visualization of ball possession dynamics, improving analytical insights.


#### Outcomes
- Robust detection and tracking of players, referees, and the ball.
- Enhanced visual clarity through the replacement of bounding boxes with circles and additional annotations like triangles for possession and ball marking.
- A reliable framework for integrating additional analytics modules.

### 3. Team Color Assignment

#### 3.1 Tools and Technology
- **K-Means Clustering**: Categorized player t-shirt colors into team groups.
- **NumPy and OpenCV**: Processed image data to extract color features for clustering.

#### 3.2 Methodology

The **Team Color Assignment** module aimed to classify players into their respective teams based on their t-shirt colors. This process included:
- Extracting pixel data from player bounding boxes.
- Focusing on the top half of the bounding box to isolate t-shirt colors from background pixels.
- Using K-Means clustering to group t-shirt colors into two clusters, corresponding to the two teams on the pitch.

A **team-color dictionary** dynamically linked each player’s track ID to their assigned team color. In cases where the color could not be determined, a fallback mechanism ensured uninterrupted functionality by assigning a default color.

#### 3.3 Validation
- Annotated bounding boxes with team colors were reviewed in video outputs to ensure accurate team assignment.
- Handled challenging scenarios such as visually similar team colors and varying lighting conditions.

#### 3.4 Outcomes
- Reliable team classification across frames.
- Enhanced visual clarity for analysts during playback.

### 4. Ball Interpolation

#### 4.1 Tools and Technology
- **Pandas**: Efficiently handled missing ball position data and performed interpolation.

#### 4.2 Methodology

Ball occlusions or rapid movements often resulted in missed detections. To address this:
1. Frames without ball detections were identified and flagged.
2. A straight-line interpolation method was applied to estimate the ball’s position during undetected intervals.
3. Missing positions were backfilled using Pandas to ensure completeness.

#### 4.3 Validation
- Overlaid interpolated ball trajectories on video frames for manual verification.
- Ensured interpolated paths aligned with realistic ball movement patterns.

#### 4.4 Outcomes
- Seamless ball tracking throughout the video, even during occlusions.
- Accurate trajectories for advanced analyses such as ball possession and passing patterns.

### 5. Camera Movement Estimation

#### 5.1 Tools and Technology
- **Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow**: Tracked movement of static field features across frames.
- **OpenCV**: Visualized and adjusted for camera movement.

#### 5.2 Methodology

Dynamic camera actions, such as panning and zooming, could distort player and ball movements. The Camera Movement Estimation module:
1. Selected static field features (e.g., banners, field edges) for reliable tracking.
2. Measured displacements of these features using Optical Flow to calculate camera movement vectors.
3. Adjusted object positions by subtracting these vectors, ensuring movements reflected actual gameplay dynamics.

#### 5.3 Validation
- Tested against videos with varying camera actions, including panning and tilting.
- Compared adjusted positions to ground truth data for accuracy.

#### 5.4 Outcomes
- Eliminated false motion caused by camera actions.
- Enhanced precision in calculating player and ball metrics.

To align the video frame with real-world pitch dimensions:
1. Identified the trapezoidal boundaries of the pitch in the frame.
2. Mapped these points to a rectangular representation using `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform`.
3. Applied `cv2.warpPerspective` to correct distortions and align coordinates with actual pitch dimensions.

#### 6.3 Validation
- Verified transformed positions by overlaying them on a standardized pitch model.

#### 6.4 Outcomes
- Enabled accurate calculations of real-world positions and distances in meters.

2. Calculated speed using frame intervals and converted results to km/h for standardization.
3. Aggregated total distance covered by each player over the match.

Annotated frames displayed real-time speed and distance metrics, aiding visual validation and analysis.

#### 7.3 Validation
- Cross-referenced outputs with expected values in test scenarios.
